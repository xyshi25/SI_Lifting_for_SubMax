# Sequence-Independent-Lifting-for-a-Set-of-SubMax-Problems

Xueyu Shi, Oleg A. Prokopyev, Bo Zeng.

This repo includes the computational instances and its generated scripts for paper  "Sequence Independent Lifting for a Set of Submodular Maximization Problems".

## DESCRIPTION
Three folders:
	- "data_utils": folder for randomly generating the computational instances
	- "dataset": folder of the computational instances used in the paper
		- "MaxMonoSub_Car.zip": instances of the expected utility maximization problem with cardinality constraints; its computational results are reported in Table 1.
	- "results": the detailed computational results for each computational instances used in the paper
